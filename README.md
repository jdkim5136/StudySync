# Description of StudySync:

StudySync is a social media web application made using ReactJS, node.js, and Firebase that matches students to study groups based on their schedules. Students are matched to others based on common courses they are currently taking and they can maintain and edit their own profiles, which include their email as a form of possible contact, a profile picture, their available times during the week, and the classes they are taking. Users are able to like and dislike other users via a swipe-left/swipe-right card mechanism on the main page and also view those users' profiles. An inbox feature displays new matches for a user in card style.

# Features:

* Create an account
* Login
* Profile cards (swipe right to like, swipe left to dislike)
* Inbox notifying user of new matches
* Create profile
* Edit profile
* View other users' profiles

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
